## The following are jupiter notebooks (Data science notebooks based in python)

---------------------------------

As a college student who did not have a car their Freshman year, I was interested in which San Antonio universities were the most walker-friendly. I compiled location data such as proximity to convenience stores, public transport, restaurants, and more and created a statistical scoring model that ranks and distributes each university. In the end, I determined the top three walker-friendly universities in the San Antonio area were:

1. Texas State University (73.025)
2. Our Lady of the Lake University (71.190)
3. The University of Texas at San Antonio (62.283)

I also discovered (a little late for this one) that the university I attended, St. Mary's University (43.025) was among the lowest scores in the data set.

Overall, I had a ton of fun playing with the Foursquare API to obtain this data. I highly recommend it to anyone who needs solid location data.

---------------------------------

This project involved scraping wikipedia for data on neighborhoods and programmatically obtaining latitudes and logitudes for those locations. I was then able to use a data science method called clustering to map out common neighborhoods.
